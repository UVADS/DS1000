# Initial Thoughts

Fundamental Concepts
1. Data Structures - aka buckets - ie: information/data can be contained in buckets like scalar,vector,tensor,etc - think of data like water
2. Pipeline - a series of data structures and their connective systems ie: a bucket brigade designed to make use of the water
3. Impedance - the cost of moving data/information from one structure to the next
    * ie when you take a dot product of two 3-vectors you go from six floats to one float
    * you lose water as it moves down the bucket brigade but it becomes more useful for a specfic purpose
